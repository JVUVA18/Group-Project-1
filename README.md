  In the United States there are few things more engrained within our nation’s culture than professional sports. To go along with that, is endless debates within the media of which players and teams have had the most success. This could be seen from number of championships, to longevity, to the phrase, “What have you done for me lately?” and everything in between. This project intends to approach the question of what makes a team successful from a more numerical perspective.
	The aim of this project was to examine how much success franchises in the NBA are having from a perspective that looks past the league’s stars and instead examines other intangibles such as team profits, franchise attendance totals over seasons and the relative average ages of each team in the league, using win percentage as a constant for these comparisons. 
	First point of comparison was the teams win percentage and how much of an effect that had on yearly attendance for that team. The primary question for this comparison was if team performance for the season, had any effect on the amount of people attending games.
